* **Repository**. Contains folders with any type of data. It’s common to include a README and license file if applicable.
* **Branch**. Mechanism to work on different versions at one time. Default is master, considered to be the “definitive” branch. Other branches are used to experiment and make edits before committing to master. Creating a branch off the master branch automatically copies (snapshots) master at that point in time. You can “pull” changes made to master while you were working on the branch. When the change is ready, it is merged into master. 
* **Pull Requests**. Proposing changes and requesting somebody to review and pull the changes and merge into another branch. Pull requests show the diffs. In Pull request message, can use @mentions.
